Five eyes.\r\n\r\n• The Beetle has two armor-like chitin plates on its head and back, presumably for defense. It seems to secrete a waxy substance.\r\n\r\n• Beetles appear to be social in nature, with a hierarchy I cannot discern. I witnessed a group of 4 beetles resting under a tree, when a stray fifth came around. They promptly sprang up and repeatedly head-butted the creature until it left, battered and bruised.\r\n\r\n• Tharson has reported to me that the Beetles are highly aggressive and territorial. \r\n","BEETLEGUARD_BODY_NAME":"Bishop of Besik","BEETLEGUARD_BODY_LORE":"<style=cMono>\r\n$ Transcribing image... done.\r\n$ Resolving... done.\r\n$ Outputting text strings... done.\r\nComplete!\r\n</style>\r\n\r\nThis is the logbook entry of D.

I observe from afar a giant cousin of the previously described Worker Beetles. \r\n\r\nI will describe its properties below. I have assigned their common name as ‘Beetle Guard’.\r\n\r\n• Much greater in size than their smaller cousins, the Guard is the size of a rhinoceroses. The Guard has the same 5 eyes as the Worker's, with one of them protruding from the top of its head. This most likely allows the Guard to see while keeping its head down in a defensive position.\r\n\r\n• The Guard appears higher in the social hierarchy than the Worker. I have witnessed Workers scatter when a Guard appeared.\r\n\r\n• The Guard’s chitin plates extend to cover its entire body, with only joints revealing the thinner, darker exoskeleton below. \r\n\r\n• Tharson has reported that the Guard’s chitin is significantly sturdier than the Workers. We have consumed many resources to fell this magnificent creature, including our disposable missile launcher. Tharson’s battle with the Guard lasted for about an hour before it finally succumbed. Amazing! Tharson is OK from this encounter.","BISON_BODY_NAME":"Byson, 1st Baron By","GOLEM_BODY_NAME":"Golm Stone","WISP_BODY_NAME":"Less Wisp","GREATERWISP_BODY_NAME":"Jeb Akbar","LEMURIAN_BODY_NAME":"L Moore","LEMURIANBRUISER_BODY_NAME":"Ed Lemur","IMP_BODY_NAME":"Imp","IMP_BODY_LORE":"> 55a695f4fdc6d961a8d739675ca88.777a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a 7a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a7 a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a7 a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a7 a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a","JELLYFISH_BODY_NAME":"Jellyfish","JELLYFISH_BODY_LORE":"<style=cMono>\r\n$ Transcribing image... done.\r\n$ Resolving... done.\r\n$ Outputting text strings... done.\r\nComplete!\r\n</style>\r\n\r\nThis is the logbook entry of D.

I have assigned their common name as ‘Icarian Jellyfish’.\r\n\r\n• Large, round invertebrate, about 2m in diameter, with two trailing tentacles. They shimmer a white-blue. They greatly resemble Medusozoa from Earth. \r\n\r\n• They seem to be experiencing neutral buoyancy in this planet’s atmosphere, causing them to float. I theorize this is due to a unique gas composition inside of their hull, which they expel to traverse.\r\n\r\n• When observed, these Jellyfish seem to bathe in the sun, slowly rotating their bodies as they do so. They may be cold-blooded.\r\n\r\n• By my request, Tharson approached a lone Jellyfish. After detecting his presence, it began to glow, quiver, and pulse before suddenly detonating with a brilliant flash and a loud bang, causing severe burns and temporary blindness to Tharson. I theorize that by exciting the gases inside of their hulls, these Jellyfish can ignite those gases and explode, scorching everything nearby. Tharson is OK from this encounter.\r\n","CLAY_BODY_NAME":"Kelly Mann","HERMIT_CRAB_BODY_NAME":"Hermit's daughter-in-law","BELL_BODY_NAME":"Rice","CLAYBRUISER_BODY_NAME":"Clay Temple","VULTURE_BODY_NAME":"I have to have a mixture.","VULTURE_BODY_LORE":"> 9f6d5d5d41671c241a13bac58b2482deb7 is available via web profile 741c65e2d36c5f6973fd3a3a0f950.\r\n> 741c655e2d36c5f6973fd3a3aa0f950 for more information about employees during the assessment.\r\n>: negative\r\n> - Source: 741c655e2d36c5f6973fd3a36a0f950 (Personal Recording)\r\n>: Resources\r\nRead the article's >:\r\n\r\n- Start marking to view -\r\n\r\n\"Stop it!

I am joined by my good friend Tharson, who is keeping me safe through this journey.\r\n\r\n---------------------\r\n\r\nWhile assessing our landing site and the small ghostly creatures that now lay, unfortunately flat, under our ship, we heard loud booming footsteps approaching. We stepped away to observe this lifeform’s behavior from afar.\r\n\r\nI will describe its properties below. I have assigned their common name as ‘Parent’.\r\n\r\n• Tall, lumbering giants, eerily humanoid. Where you would expect to see a face there is only a hole, giving a blank look to them. Their ghostly skin appears to run like wax but even so it does not seem to congeal at their feet.\r\n\r\n• Their large hands have opposable thumbs. This could possibly mean that they have the capability for intelligence, using tools or testing their environment with dextrous manipulation.\r\n\r\n• If we hadn’t taken up this vantage point when we did, the creature would have been upon us before we realized it. Its distant footstep sounds betrayed how quickly it closed the distance.\r\n\r\n• I had Tharson throw a stone near the creature and suddenly any signs of intelligence faded, replaced with primal fury. Deadly, wild force rained down as it smashed the ground with its fists, searching for the perpetrator of its peaceful moment. Our ship was not OK from this encounter.\r\n","MINIMUSHROOM_BODY_NAME":"Minisam","MINIMUSHROOM_BODY_LORE":"<style=cMono>\r\n$ Transcribing image... done.\r\n$ Resolving... done.\r\n$ Outputting text strings... done.\r\nComplete!\r\n</style>\r\n\r\nThis is the logbook entry of D.

Thinking we would take some samples back to test if they were edible, we noticed some of the smaller variety sprout up from the ground and circle around us.\r\n\r\nI will describe its properties below. I have assigned their common name as ‘Mini Mushrum’.\r\n\r\n• ‘Mini’ is a relative term here, as these mobile mushrooms were larger than Tharson. The subtle glow on the underside of their cap is probably to scare away predators, advertising that they are dangerous to eat.\r\n\r\n• Waddling around on short, stubby legs makes them seem quite unsuited for walking. They comically bump into things as they fret about. Perhaps their eyeseight is poor from living in the dark?\r\n\r\n• After a long time studying their movements, I suggested to Tharson to retrieve a sample from one to take back with us. The one that the sample was taken from began to flee as the others began shaking, spilling their spores into the air. Our air filtration warnings went off so we left before the cloud of fungal gas became too overwhelming. We did not eat the sample.\r\n","POD_BODY_NAME":"Shells from ancestors","LUNARWISP_BODY_NAME":"Lunar Camera","LUNARWISP_BODY_SUBTITLE":"Peak mode","LUNARWISP_BODY_LORE":"The soul was clearly killed.
